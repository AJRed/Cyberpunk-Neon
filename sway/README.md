# Sway

![Cyberpunk Neon theme in Sway](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roboron3042/Cyberpunk-Neon/master/resources/screenshots/sway.png)

## Sway style
You can copy the theme for border (and cursor), including the style file in your sway config.

Note: I only really need border for the current focused window, so the inactive broder is set to background color. If you want a more visible border, replace #000b1e with #0abdc6 (for example) on client.[focused_inactive|unfocused]

## Mako

If using mako for notifications on sway, this color match the popup, and add a nice box radius.

`cp -r mako ~/.config`

## Rofi

If you use the rofi launcher you can add rofi/config to your existing ~/.config/rofi/config to match the colors of cyberpunk neon theme

`cp -r rofi ~/.config`

## Waybar

The waybar config & style.css are on the waybar folder. Simply copy them and restart sway to get the layout.

`cp -r waybar ~/.config`

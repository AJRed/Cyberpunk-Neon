# Discord Cyberpunk-Neon

This is the Cyberpunk Neon theme for Discord. Everything is recolored to fit the theme. But nothing more than the colors are changed.

## Installation
* [BetterDiscord](https://gist.github.com/ObserverOfTime/d7e60eb9aa7fe837545c8cb77cf31172): Download the CSS file (you can click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roboron3042/Cyberpunk-Neon/master/CSS/discord/Discord-Cyberpunk-Neon.theme.css) and right-click in the page to "Save As...". Then save the .css file in BetterDiscord's theme folder.

And don't forget to apply in BetterDiscord Theme Settings!

* Discord in a browser (Firefox, Chrome...), use the [userstyles version](https://userstyles.org/styles/174712/discord-cyberpunk-neon) with the Stylus extension.

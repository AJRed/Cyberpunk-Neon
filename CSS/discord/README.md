# Discord Cyberpunk-Neon

This is the Cyberpunk Neon theme for Discord. Everything is recolored to fit the theme. But nothing more than the colors are changed.

## Installation
You can choose between the classic version and the transparent version with a custom image background (screenshots below). **If you have problems with custom images not loading on the transparent version, try to upload them to imgur.com first**. Please notice that the transparent version is not my main focus and it can get some improvements.

### BetterDiscord
First, install [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases) if you don't already have it.

* Classic version: Download the discord-cyberpunk-neon CSS file (you can click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roboron3042/Cyberpunk-Neon/master/CSS/discord/discord-cyberpunk-neon.theme.css) and right-click in the page to "Save As...". Then save the .css file in BetterDiscord's theme folder.
* Transparent version: Download the discord-cyberpunk-neon-Transparent CSS file (you can click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roboron3042/Cyberpunk-Neon/master/CSS/discord/discord-cyberpunk-neon-transparent.theme.css) and right-click in the page to "Save As...". Then save the .css file in BetterDiscord's theme folder. If you want to change the background, edit the CSS file and change the URL image (instructions inside).

And don't forget to apply in BetterDiscord Theme Settings! This version will update itself everytime you open Discord.

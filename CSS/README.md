## CSS Themes

I've applied the Cyberpunk-Neon color scheme to some websites. You can install and manage them directly via greasyfork.org. Currently available websites are:

* Mastodon (classic) - [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/es/scripts/409167-mastodon-cyberpunk-neon)
* TweetDeck (dark) - [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/es/scripts/409158-tweetdeck-cyberpunk-neon) 

Note: Styles available via userstyles.org are no longer supported. Please dont't use those.
